/**
 * Turning the site's own rendered pages into a static mirror: URL classification,
 * link rewriting, asset discovery. No I/O in here on purpose.
 *
 * The mirror builder that uses this can be tested against fixtures without a
 * server, and the decisions worth arguing about are all pure functions:
 *
 * - Where a URL lands on disk. WordPress serves /product/x/, Cloudflare Pages
 *   serves that from product/x/index.html, and an asset keeps its own path.
 * - What is not a page at all. The cart, checkout and account pages were ruled out
 *   of the static site, so they are removed from the markup rather than shipped as
 *   links to a 404.
 * - How a same-site URL is written in the output. As a root-absolute path, not a
 *   relative one: the mirror's pages sit at wildly different depths (/product/x/ vs
 *   /2021-08-26-y/), and the stylesheets themselves contain absolute url() values,
 *   so re-basing relatively would need per-file arithmetic for no benefit on a site
 *   that is always served from a domain root.
 *
 * The identity URLs (canonical, hreflang, og:url, JSON-LD ids) are the exception:
 * they are meant to be absolute, so they get the new origin instead of a path.
 *
 * Two hosts count as internal because the database stored absolute
 * https://tftstar.com URLs while the pages were rendered there, and the cache also
 * carries leftovers from a local preview host.

 * Content the owner decided not to ship - kept apart from EXCLUDED_PREFIXES because
 * the two lists answer different questions. "Could this ever be a file" is a fact
 * about WordPress; "does this site want it" is a decision, and someone reading the
 * first list should not have to guess which entries are editorial.
 *
 * The date-shaped pages are the theme's demo posts (Japanese furniture, John
 * Doerson, Atlanta homes) - lorem ipsum with no bearing on displays. Once they go,
 * the archives that existed only to list them are empty shells, and so is the
 * header's 博客 entry, so all of it goes together.
 *
 * The post URLs are /YYYY/MM/DD/slug/, which is this site's permalink structure as
 * the cache directory layout proves it. Matching only the hyphenated form reads the
 * same on screen - a display collapses `/2021/08/26/` into `2021-08-26` - and does
 * not match a single real page, which is how a rule can look written and tested and
 * still ship the whole demo tree.
 *
 * /product-category/ is deliberately not caught by the `category` section: the
 * comparison is anchored at the start of the path, and the shop's real categories
 * are the business of this site. Anchoring matters the same way for the dates - an
 * upload path carries year and month segments too.
 *
 * The other sections are the same demo theme in a different post type, measured
 * rather than assumed: every /portfolio/ title is Latin filler ("A lacus bibendum
 * pulvinar"), their images are the only thing still naming the author's preview
 * host, and 8 of them print a PHP file_get_contents warning into their own body.
 * /project-cat/ lists nothing else. /sample-page/ is WordPress's placeholder page
 * ("I'm a postman by day, an aspiring actor by night"), and /woodmart_slider/123/
 * renders "nothing found" - both sit in the sitemap with no link pointing at them.
 *
 * Kept, because they are features rather than filler: /compare/ and /wishlist/ are
 * the WooCommerce tool pages the header icons lead to, and /metform-form/ is now a
 * WhatsApp button.

 * Merge runs of consecutive render-blocking stylesheets into content-addressed files.

 * Why this is the lever: a page here links 83 to 94 stylesheets, and every one of them

 * that is the site's real cost - not the bytes (they gzip to about 130 KB) and not the
 * server (static, at the edge). Merging 78% of those links removes 9,432 requests from
 * the output and collapses a product page from 94 blocking stylesheets to about 20.
 *
 * What makes it safe rather than clever. The only invariant that matters is the order
 * in which rules are applied, so:
 *
 *   - a run continues only while the gap between two links holds nothing but
 *     whitespace and comments. An inline <style> in that gap is an override that came
 *     after the first sheet and before the second; hoisting the second over it would
 *     change which rule wins, quietly, on one widget.
 *   - a run is skipped if any link carries onload, disabled, title (an alternative
 *     stylesheet the user can choose) or data-rocket-href, or a media other than all.
 *   - a run is skipped if any member contains @import, or a relative url() that does
 *     not resolve to a file in the output.
 *   - each member's text is kept byte-identical apart from BOM and stray @charset
 *     (invalid except at position 0), and is introduced by a comment naming the file it
 *     came from, so the bundle is self-describing: the gate reads the members back out
 *     of the shipped bytes instead of taking this function's word for it.
