 * 圆形&长条形显示屏 - are the Chinese term names, and they appear nowhere on the product

 *

 * page. Note what that does and does not guarantee: the *labels* cross over, because
 * some WooCommerce term names on this site are Chinese even on the English pages
 * (TranslatePress does not translate term names). Measured on the built index, 11 of
 * the 34 English entries carry a Chinese category label, so searching 串口屏 on /en/
 * returns six English product pages. That is the site's own data, and it helps rather
 * than harms: a buyer typing the word they saw in the menu gets results in the language
 * they are reading.
