/**
 * Generate the two media optimisations this site ships, and record them in one manifest.
 *
 *   npm run images
 *
 * Neither is part of `npm run mirror`, and that separation is the point: the mirror has
 * no network step and no image codec, so it stays reproducible on any machine. This
 * script needs `sharp` (devDependency) and, for posters only, a local `ffmpeg`. When it
 * has not been run, the manifest is absent and the mirror ships the backup's own bytes -
 * a slower site, not a broken one.
 *
 * What it writes, all under work/media/ (gitignored, disposable, derived):
 *   files/<original path>.webp          the same picture, smaller
 *   files/<original path>.poster.webp   a video's own first frame
 *   manifest.json                       the mapping the mirror reads
 *
 * Two measured decisions live here rather than in the mirror:
 *
 *   - Only images above MIN_KB, and only when WebP comes out at least MIN_SAVING
 *     smaller. Measured across the fourteen largest files in the uploads tree, WebP
 *     went 30,495 KB to 3,951 KB (87%), but `Detail-16-topaz-enhance-2.9x.jpg` went
 *     835 KB to 780 KB (7%) - and a 7% saving is not worth a second file and a rewritten
 *     reference. On the images the shipped pages actually ask for, nothing was lost to
 *     the saving rule: every file that cleared the size floor beat 25%.
 *   - Posters come from the video itself. The pages offer no honest alternative: every
 *     product page's "featured image" is the same site-wide placeholder
 *     (`62b9cc781cece.png`), so using it would paste one unrelated picture over fourteen
 *     different products, which is worse than a black rectangle.
 *
 * MIN_KB started at 150 KB, which is where the obvious wins are. The live probe then
 * found four 149 KB PNGs still shipping as originals, so the band under the floor got
 * counted: 155 referenced files, 12.4 MB. The floor is now 40 KB - below that a WebP
 * saves tens of kilobytes at best, and the manifest, the file count and the repository
 * each pay for every one.
