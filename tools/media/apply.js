/**
 * Apply the media manifest that `npm run images` produced to a finished document.
 *
 * The manifest maps two kinds of thing:
 *
 *   images   /wp-content/uploads/2023/12/big.png  ->  the same picture as .png.webp
 *   posters  /wp-content/uploads/2023/12/movie.mp4 -> that video's own first frame
 *
 * Both are applied here, at the end of the page pass, because that is the only point
 * where a reference has its final spelling. Earlier the same file appears as an
 * absolute URL on the backup's host, as a root-relative path, percent-encoded, and
 * verbatim; later it also sits inside `srcset` lists, Elementor's `data-settings`
 * JSON, inline `url()`, and `og:image`. An attribute-by-attribute rewrite would have
 * to enumerate all of that and got it wrong twice already in this project, so instead
 * the rule appends `.webp` to whatever spelling the document actually contains - the
 * match is the replacement's prefix. Percent-encoded and raw spellings both resolve to
 * the one decoded file the host serves, which is how the mirror already ships the
 * uploads tree.
 *
 * The substitution never touches the backup's files: the converted bytes live under
 * work/media/ and reach dist through the asset map, so a machine that has not run
 * `npm run images` builds the site exactly as it did before - slower, not broken.

 * inside `x.jpg.webp` that this very rule already wrote, so a dot, a dash, a percent
 * sign and word characters all mean "this is a longer name, leave it alone".
