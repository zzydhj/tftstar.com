/**
 * Build the static mirror from the site's own rendered page cache.
 *
 *   node tools/mirror.mjs [--site-origin https://example.com] [--dry]
 *
 * The input is WP Rocket's cache under work/wp/.../cache/wp-rocket/<host>/, which
 * holds the HTML WordPress finished producing: complete documents with the theme's
 * header and footer, for both languages. That is why no PHP is needed here, and why
 * the result can be a true 1:1 rather than a reconstruction.
 *
 * Three things are decided in this file rather than assumed:
 *
 * 1. Which variant to ship. Every cached page exists as a desktop
 *    (index-https.html) and a mobile (index-mobile-https.html) document, served
 *    apart by User-Agent. A static host cannot vary on User-Agent, so the desktop
 *    document is the one that ships, and the three pages that only have a mobile
 *    variant fall back with a report instead of silently differing.
 *
 * 2. Which URL a page is. Taken from the directory it was cached in, because that
 *    tree mirrors the site's URL path segment for segment. The canonical link is
 *    read only to cross-check it: 97 of the 217 cached pages - every archive, the
 *    shop, the blog, categories, an author page and the paginated pages - carry no
 *    canonical at all, which is WordPress behaviour on those templates rather than
 *    damage in the backup. Keying on the canonical would have deleted 45% of the
 *    mirror's pages, including the whole product catalogue's structure.
 *
 * 3. What happens to a reference. Handled by staticize.js: same-site files are
 *    copied and written as root-absolute paths, cart and account links are removed
 *    by the earlier decision, and head metadata keeps an absolute URL on the new
 *    origin because a canonical pointing at the old host would tell search engines
 *    this mirror is somebody else's copy.
 *
 * The desktop and mobile files are byte-identical for 214 of the 217 directories,
 * so preferring one of them costs nothing; the three that exist only as mobile are
 * reported rather than skipped.
