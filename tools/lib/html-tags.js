 *
 * Both the search index (which measures the product loop) and the staticizer (which
 * removes whole Elementor widgets) need to know where an element ends. A regex cannot
 * say: `<ul>` nests `<ul>`, `<div>` nests `<div>`, and cutting at the first `</ul>`
 * silently eats part of the document. One scanner, shared, so the two cannot disagree
 * about what "this element" means.

/**
 * Index just past the closing tag of the element whose opening tag starts at `from`.
 *
 * `from` must point at `<` of an opening `<tag ...>`; the scan counts that element
 * first, so depth reaches zero at its own close. Returns the end of the string when
 * the document is unbalanced, which for our input means the cached page really is
 * truncated and the caller should treat the remainder as the element.

 * preceding `<div` there would delete real content on the strength of a selector.
