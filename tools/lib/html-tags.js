 * `from` must point at `<` of an opening `<tag ...>`; the scan counts that element
 * first, so depth reaches zero at its own close. Returns the end of the string when
 * the document is unbalanced, which for our input means the cached page really is
 * truncated and the caller should treat the remainder as the element.

 * `id='wd-woo-opt-title-limit-css'`, so a substring test reports nearly every
 * stylesheet on the site as an alternative stylesheet (`title=`), and a build rule
 * quietly does nothing while still reporting the counts it expected. One parser, so
 * the builder and the gate cannot disagree about what an attribute means.
