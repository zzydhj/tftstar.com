 * (`/wp-json/metform/v1/entries/insert/16312`) simply does not exist on a static
 * host, so a visitor filled the form, pressed send, and got no answer and no error.

 * enquiry buttons use - so the result is styled by the theme rather than by anything
 * added here, which is what "unify" has to mean for a button.
 *
 * The metform scripts are deliberately left loaded: with no container they render
 * nothing, and removing the tags would change the reference counts the build compares
 * against the cache for no user-visible gain.
 *

 * an Elementor widget (`elementor-widget-metform`), which is what the header and
 * footer template carries on 211 pages. On metform's own pages the plugin prints the

/**
 * The mobile bottom bar, rebuilt with three entries that go somewhere.
 *
 * As shipped by the source site it is three items labelled `123`, all pointing at
 * http://starbillions.savetime.work/ - somebody's preview host, not this site, and
 * not reachable. Only the first item carries an icon; the other two have an empty
 * icon span, which is where the two gear wheels in the screenshot come from: the
 * theme's base `.wd-icon` rule supplies a default glyph when no specific icon class
 * is set, and no `wd-icon-*:before` rule exists anywhere in the mirror's CSS, so
 * there is no font glyph to choose instead.
 *
 * The destinations are the three things a phone visitor of a component supplier
 * actually wants, each verified to exist as a built page: the phone number the site
 * already publishes, the product listing, and the contact page. The English entries
 * point at /en/产品中心/ and /en/联系我们/ because those are the paths the mirror
 * really wrote - TranslatePress keeps the Chinese slug for the default language and
 * the mirror reproduces it, so an invented English slug would 404.
 *
 * The icons are inline SVG with `fill="currentColor"`, not image files. That is a
 * deliberate unification, measured: the site's own `uploads/2023/11/phone.svg` has
 * `#0066b6` baked into it and does not read currentColor, while a hand-drawn file was
 * dark, so three items in one bar rendered in two different colours and nothing in CSS
 * could have reconciled them. Inheriting the link's text colour makes the theme the
 * single owner of the icon colour, hover state and colour scheme included.
